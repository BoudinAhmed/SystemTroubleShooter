# System TroubleShooter  [![WPF CI Build](https://github.com/BoudinDjama/SystemTroubleShooter/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/BoudinDjama/SystemTroubleShooter/actions/workflows/main.yml)

As someone who enjoys fixing IT issues and always looks for opportunities to automate with PowerShell, the concept of building an app for common/company-specific problems was very appealing. Throughout this project, I have applied my years of IT experience. It has also significantly deepened my passion and love for programming.

The System TroubleShooter is a desktop application aimed at automating the resolution of frequent IT problems. It utilizes the MVVM architecture within the WPF framework, creating a clean separation of concerns and facilitating maintainability. The project is currently under active development, with ongoing efforts to revise the user interface and restructure the application for improved functionality.
