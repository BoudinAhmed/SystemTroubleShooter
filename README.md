# System TroubleShooter

As someone who enjoys fixing IT issues and always looks for opportunities to automate with PowerShell, the concept of building a troubleshooter app for common or company-specific problems was very appealing. Throughout this project, I have applied my years of practical IT experience and it has also significantly deepened my passion and love for programming.

Working on a completely new version of the application, currently under active development and reconstruction. I am in the process of revising the user interface and re-structuring the code behind, fully utilizing PowerShell for enhanced diagnostic and repair functions.


This software is a helpful desktop utility built with **C#** and the **WPF** framework, using the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** design pattern. This application will assist you in quickly diagnose and resolve common Windows issues, specifically focusing on **internet connectivity, sound problems, network drive mapping, ensuring your system is up-to-date, and more.**
